Description: Debian Package Builder
 Debreate is a utility to aid in creating Debian (.deb) packages. Currently it
 only supports binary packaging (note that the term "binary package" is
 used loosely, as such packages can contain scripts & non-code items such
 as media images, audio, & more) for personal distribution. Plans for using
 backends such as dh_make & debuild for creating source packages are in
 the works. But source packaging can be quite different & is a must if you
 want to get your packages into a distribution's official repositories or a
 Launchpad Personal Package Archive (PPA). The latter from which
 Debreate is available.
