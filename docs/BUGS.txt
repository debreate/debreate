-- Known Bugs --

Must be fixed before release:
- License templates not being installed

Priority:
- Generate template button on copyright page moves header for system licenses
- Error if user deletes license template while app is open & attempts to generate:
  - TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, NoneType found

Non-priority:
- Detailed progress dialog does not always size correctly on construction
- Menu/Launcher page: Text in 'Other' text area is highlighted in gray when imported
  - Always occurs with wx 3.0
  - Only occurs when using 'WriteText' method in wx 2.8
- wx 2.8:
  - Taskbar icon does not show up
- wx 3.0 only:
  - Credits list does not expand completely on right edge
- Some binary executables are recognized as 'application/x-sharedlib' MIME type from 'file' command
  - Find a workaround to display these as binary executables in directory tree
- 'None' is written to first line of log file output
- Error occurs sometimes after add changelog entries:
  - (init.py:4644) Gtk-CRITICAL **: IA__gtk_main_quit: assertion 'main_loops != NULL' failed
- Progress dialogs could potentially resize outside of display boundaries
- Does not show on main screen after First Run
- Auto-Link Help only re-centers if "check" button is pressed
- 'Distribution' text input cannot be tabbed out of on changelog page
  - May be an issue with custom combo box
