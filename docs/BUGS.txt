-- Known Bugs --

Release:
- Executables fail to import to scripts page
- md5sum produces different hash for binary files than debuild
- Lintian reports:
  - no-section-field
  - md5sums-lists-nonexistent-file usr/share/debreate/bitmaps/browse64.pn
  - file-missing-in-md5sums usr/share/debreate/bitmaps/browse64.png
- PanelMenu pops up no matter where you click on the PanelMenuBar
- wx._core.PyDeadObjectError caused by input.essential.EssentialField.NotifyMainWindow when app is closed
- wx 3.0:
  - 'Refresh' & 'Browse' buttons on hidden on files page if width is sized down
- wizbin.control: TypeError in ExportBuild method
  - "Export() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)"
- Cannot save project:
  - globals.fileio.WriteFile: IOError: "Is a directory ..."

Priority:

Non-priority:
- Log window has some issues with wx.Yield (only affects debugging mode)
- Detailed progress dialog does not always size correctly on construction
- wx 2.8:
  - Taskbar icon does not show up
- wx 3.0 only:
  - Credits list does not expand completely on right edge
- Some binary executables are recognized as 'application/x-sharedlib' MIME type from 'file' command
  - Find a workaround to display these as binary executables in directory tree
- Error occurs sometimes after add changelog entries:
  - (init.py:4644) Gtk-CRITICAL **: IA__gtk_main_quit: assertion 'main_loops != NULL' failed
- Progress dialogs could potentially resize outside of display boundaries
- Does not show on main screen after First Run
- Auto-Link Help only re-centers if "check" button is pressed
- 'Distribution' text input cannot be tabbed out of on changelog page
  - May be an issue with custom combo box
