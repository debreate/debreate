-- Known Bugs --

required for release:
- changelog page does not reset
- catching lintian output after build broken
- files & directories created with non-standard permissions
- md5sums are incorrect

priority:
- files page: elements don't resize when narrowing page

non-priority:
- file selection via directory tree broken in wx 4.0 & 4.1
- Detailed progress dialog does not always size correctly on construction
- Menu/Launcher page: Text in 'Other' text area is highlighted in gray when imported
  - Always occurs with wx 3.0
- Some binary executables are recognized as 'application/x-sharedlib' MIME type from 'file' command
  - Find a workaround to display these as binary executables in directory tree
- Error occurs sometimes after add changelog entries:
  - (init.py:4644) Gtk-CRITICAL **: IA__gtk_main_quit: assertion 'main_loops != NULL' failed
- Progress dialogs could potentially resize outside of display boundaries
