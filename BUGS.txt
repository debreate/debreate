-- Known Bugs --

required for release:

priority:
- system information tab in about dialog does not layout properly until after resize
- can't disable tooltips under Gtk

non-priority:
- file selection via directory tree broken in wx 4.0 & 4.1
- Detailed progress dialog does not always size correctly on construction
- Menu/Launcher page: Text in 'Other' text area is highlighted in gray when imported
  - Always occurs with wx 3.0
- wx 3.0 only:
  - Credits list does not expand completely on right edge
- Some binary executables are recognized as 'application/x-sharedlib' MIME type from 'file' command
  - Find a workaround to display these as binary executables in directory tree
- Error occurs sometimes after add changelog entries:
  - (init.py:4644) Gtk-CRITICAL **: IA__gtk_main_quit: assertion 'main_loops != NULL' failed
- Progress dialogs could potentially resize outside of display boundaries
- Auto-Link Help only re-centers if "check" button is pressed
- 'Distribution' text input cannot be tabbed out of on changelog page
  - May be an issue with custom combo box
